## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Is there some state we need to initialize?
6) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
7) Think about how to validate each of your steps


Make A list of things

Make objects for each item:
make an array with multiple objects
Each item needs: name, image, description, category, price

Make hard code ID in html with list

Think about dynamic structure

Create html items dynamically in JS

import items 

create function to make li

import function to tie it all together
